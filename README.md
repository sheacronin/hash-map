# Hash Map

[Hash Map project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap) from The Odin Project's Ruby Course, exercising understanding of data structures.

Uses [Linked List gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/shea-linked_list) ([repo](https://github.com/sheacronin/linked-list)) I created from the previous project to handle collisions in the hash map.
